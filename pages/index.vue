    <p>
      My name is Martin Fracker. I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Computer Science.
      I excel at many things including programming in Rails, CSharp, Node.js, Vue.js, Angular.js,
      test-driven development, and agile development. My passion is writing programs in C++ specifically
      on the Linux platform using Emacs, but I have experience writing web applications in ASP.NET MVC,
      Vue.js, Angular.js, and Rails. Testing first is just as important to me as a finished product, and
      when working in a team I enjoy employing agile best practices.
