      My name is Martin Fracker. I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S.
      in Computer Science. I excel at many things including programming in Rails,
      CSharp, Node.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, test-driven development, and agile
      development. I like writing programs in C++ specifically on the Linux
      platform using Emacs, but my focus is on writing web applications using
      various technologies, including ASP.NET MVC, Vue.js, Angular.js, and Rails.
      Testing first is just as important to me as a finished product, and when
      working in a team I enjoy employing agile best practices. When I'm not at
      work I am either watching TV, playing table tennis, working out, or playing
      Dota.
