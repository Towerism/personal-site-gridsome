    My name is Martin Fracker. I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S.
    in Computer Science. I excel at many things including programming in Rails,
    CSharp, Node.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, test-driven development, and agile
    development. I like writing programs in C++ specifically on the Linux
    platform using Emacs, but my focus is on writing web applications using
    various technologies, including ASP.NET MVC, Vue.js, Angular.js, and Rails.
    Testing first is just as important to me as a finished product, and when
    working in a team I enjoy employing agile best practices. When I'm not at
    work I am either watching TV, playing table tennis, working out, or playing
    Dota.
