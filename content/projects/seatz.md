  Developed apps that enable a customer to order delivery of stadium food/drink/souvenirs from their phone.

As lead developer of the software engineering team, I developed and maintain
both customer-facing and internal mobile applications as well as the backend
services these apps talk to. I also automated and oversee all software
deployments. Besides this, I manage our other developers who work on an
internal web application which we use to manage our operations infrastructure.
