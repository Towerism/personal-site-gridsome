Working with a client which provides a social media platform to its clients to
add features to and stabilize the platform. As a full-stack developer I am
working with the MEAN stack as well as Docker and Elasticsearch. Besides adding
new features, I have improved the development process by upgrading the backend
from Node 5 to LTS Node 8, streamlining the docker workflow by speeding up the
time it takes to start the containers, and dockerizing elasticsearch. I also
played a significant role in upgrading from Elasticsearch 2.4 to 5.6.
