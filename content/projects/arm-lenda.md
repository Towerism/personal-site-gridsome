Worked in a cross-functional scrum team to develop a management operations web
application for a company which provides risk management solutions for
agribusiness. Within the first year in production, closed more than a
half-billion dollarsâ€™ worth of loans. Set up continuous delivery using Jenkin
and Azure, later using Visual Studio Team Services, allowing my team to deploy
multiple times per week. Interested in upgrading the tech stack, team looked
into Vue.js, Angular, .NET core, and Docker. Using the Agile Scrum methodology
together with test-driven development and technologies such as AngularJS,
Vue.js, Angular, ASP.NET Web API, .NET Core, Jasmine, Jenkins, Azure, Visual
Studio Team Services, Docker, Selenium, Protractor.NET, Twitter Bootstrap, and
Entity Framework, my role was that of a full stack developer.
