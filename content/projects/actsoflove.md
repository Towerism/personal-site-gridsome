Developed a website that allows people to share stories about acts of kindness
in the workplace that had a positive impact in their lives in order to inspire
business leaders. Worked as a tech lead with a content creator and a UX
designer to build the front-end using vue.js which would use an existing MEAN
stack application as a headless CMS.
